## 🎯 Description

**Salary Management System** is a full-stack web application built with **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS**.

It helps small businesses or HR managers securely manage:
- Employee records
- Payroll data like pay dates and bonuses.
- Final salary calculations

The app includes **user authentication**, full **CRUD functionality**, and **authorization** — meaning only the logged-in user can manage their data.
